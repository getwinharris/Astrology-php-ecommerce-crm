# Public Interface Design System

This is the canonical visual contract for customer-facing pages in `views/` and `assets/css/band.css`. It adapts the supplied marketplace reference to Sri Panchami Spiritual without copying travel-specific content or navigation.

## Principles

- Keep the interface calm, white, photo-first, and content-led.
- Use one public brand accent. Decorative spiritual imagery may retain its source colors, but UI chrome must not reintroduce a competing gold, maroon, or gradient theme.
- Prefer whitespace, typography, hairline borders, and one restrained shadow tier over decorative panels.
- Keep the existing PHP templates, routes, forms, and JSON-backed behavior. Design changes must not scaffold a second frontend.

## Tokens

### Color

- Canvas: `#ffffff`
- Soft surface: `#f7f7f7`
- Subtle surface: `#f2f2f2`
- Primary ink: `#222222`
- Body ink: `#3f3f3f`
- Muted ink: `#6a6a6a`
- Soft ink: `#929292`
- Hairline border: `#dddddd`
- Soft divider: `#ebebeb`
- Strong border: `#c1c1c1`
- Brand / primary action: `#ff385c`
- Brand active: `#e00b41`
- Brand disabled: `#ffd1da`
- Success and error colors are semantic exceptions and must not become general decoration.

### Typography

- Use Inter with system sans-serif fallbacks for all public text.
- Do not use a separate serif display family.
- Page headings are generally `22px` to `28px`, weight `600` to `700`.
- Body copy is `14px` to `16px`, weight `400`, line-height `1.45` to `1.6`.
- Labels and metadata are `12px` to `14px`, weight `500` to `600`.
- Letter spacing is `0`. Uppercase is reserved for short operational labels.

### Geometry

- Spacing scale: `2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px`.
- Radius scale: `4, 8, 14, 20, 32px`, plus fully rounded pills.
- Inputs and standard buttons are `48px` high with an `8px` radius.
- Search and filter controls may be `64px` high and fully rounded.
- Repeated photo cards use a `14px` radius and stable media aspect ratio.
- Use `0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)` as the standard elevated shadow. Do not stack decorative shadow tiers.

## Components

- Header: white, approximately `80px` high on desktop, hairline bottom border, compact logo, centered primary navigation, active underline, and right-aligned account/cart actions.
- Navigation: retain the product's real routes and labels. Do not copy reference-product labels that do not exist in this application.
- Buttons: primary buttons use solid `#ff385c` with white text. Secondary buttons use white or transparent backgrounds, ink text, and a hairline border. Hover states must not move layout.
- Forms: white fields, clear labels, `8px` radius, strong ink focus ring, and no glow effects.
- Search/filter surfaces: use a single rounded search control or a quiet grouped filter row; keep labels and values readable without card nesting.
- Cards: image first, consistent crop, compact hierarchy, restrained metadata, and no ornamental overlays. Hover may add the standard shadow but must not translate or scale the card.
- Hero: keep the actual deity imagery visible and correctly framed against white or a soft neutral surface. Text remains compact and left aligned on desktop; slides must show one image at a time.
- Footer: white or soft neutral with ink text and a hairline top border. Do not use a dark promotional footer.

## Responsive Rules

- Mobile: below `744px`; use one primary content column, compact header controls, and the existing bottom navigation.
- Tablet: `744px` through `1128px`; reduce grid columns while preserving card geometry.
- Desktop: above `1128px`; use centered containers up to `1300px` and `64px` section spacing.
- Text, buttons, images, and fixed controls must not overlap or shift when content length changes.

## Verification

- Check the home page and `/consult` at desktop and mobile widths in a real browser.
- Confirm image crops, active navigation, focus states, white canvas, card alignment, and footer contrast.
- Run the repo's PHP tests, project-map validation, and local smoke test before commit or push.
